A simple java javascript formatter.
Based on the idea found at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18985/what-javascript-code-beautifier-can-i-use-via-the-command-line-on-windows-and-li

Libraries used: 
1. rhino1_7R4 
2. http://jsbeautifier.org/beautify.js

USAGE from console: java -jar jsbeautifier.jar script indentation

example: java -jar jsbeautifier.jar "function ff() {return;}" 2

USAGE from java code:
public static String jsBeautify(String jsCode, int indentSize)

LICENSE: you are free to use, modify the code as you like. 
There's a lot of options to extend the functionality based on the input params of beautify.js.
At the moment I don't need them so everything as simple as it could be.
